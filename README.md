Using Lego Mindstorms create a robot that follows a black line. 
<p>It uses a ultrasound sensor to prevent crashing with an obstacle. </p>
<p>It also uses a sound sensor which will work as an on/off switch. When we produce a sound the robot will start working, when we produce a second sound the robot will stop.</p>
<p>It uses kinematic path planning to move robot on a semi-circular trajectory with a radius of 24cm
</p>
<p>Finally, it uses 2 light sensors that work as PID control to follow the line.</p>
